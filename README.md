About extension:

This extension is mainly focused on capturing users ( both Logged In and Guest users) activities on the Magento website. We are using free GeoIP(https://freegeoip.app/) to get the details based on the Ip.
The extension Captureâ€™s the following  user activities on the website
Products viewed on the website
Products added to the compare list on the website
Products added to the wish list on the website
Products added to the cart on the website
Categories viewed on the website
 CMS pages viewed on the website

The user location had been populated based on the IP address of the user. Since on the local machine, the IP address will be 127.0.0.1 (which may change based on your system setup) the user location details cannot be populated.

Visitor creation and management:

when a user visits the website for the first time a unique ID will be created called Visitor ID and also session Id will be created and stored. Based on the IP address rest of the data is populated and stored.
 When a visitor visits the website in the same browser, based on the session Id the same Visitor ID will be assigned.
When a visitor visits the website via a different browser or a guest/private window based on the IP address the same Visitor ID will be assigned.
When a visitor visits the website via a different browser or a guest/private window and with different IP. Based on the location details (that have been populated using the IP address) the same Visitor ID will be assigned
